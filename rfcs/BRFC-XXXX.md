# BRFC-XXXX: Signed Message Format

## Rationale

In a typical Blah IM setup, users send their messages and actions to chat server and receive corresponding responses from the server. Chat servers need to be verify the sender of the said message before acknowledging the action or message. Blah implements this by utilizing asymetrical cryptography: A *user* is represented by a pair of cryptographical keys, *public key* and *private key*. 

The keypair is generated by the user itself, and every message or action must be signed using *user*'s *private key*. Chat server verifies the *signed message* against user's published *public key*. This document defines the exact format of *signed message*.

## Scope

This document only defines a general format for delivering cryptographically verifiable data. This document is not defining the format of chat messages or actions.

The format is only designed for JSON serializable data. This means large binary blobs should not be passed around in *signed message* format.
